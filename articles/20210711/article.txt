# ESP32-PICO-D4

> A System-in-Package(SiP) module is based on ESP32, providing complete Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionalities.

You can downloaw the datasheet of ESP32-PICO-D4 from [Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/en).  

## My ESP32 board

> I didn't follow the pin definition of Type C. But makes this prototype more user-friendly.

* __Main board__

Including an ESP32 chip, an IMU, an LDO and a user define button.

To reduce the size,  the programmer is isolated from it and no I/Os are broken out.

* __Programmer__

In the programmer, a CP2102 chip convert USB to TTL.
