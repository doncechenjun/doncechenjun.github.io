# CNN

> A convolutional neural network is a DNN which can take 2D or hiegher dimension tensor as input.
> As it is strong at pattern detection, it is commonly used in the image processing, e.g., image classifier, image GAN...

Today CNN can be easily trained by personal computer thanks to high performance GPU and advanced semiconductor processing. 

## handwritten digits

> Multi class classification like handwritten digits recognition can be done if we have enougth data to train our CNN.

* __Traingin__

NN : 2 layers of CNN and one layer of FC network.

After training with 60000 data, Cross entropy is minimize to ~0.05 and the testing accuracy is up to ~98%

* __Prediction__

CNN make prediction after seeing these picture:

In these 25 pictures, it makes all the prediction right.

But there are still some mistakes:

## How about Kudō Shin-ichi and Kaitō Kiddo?

> For Mori Ran's happiness, a machine which can tell between Shin-ichi and Kiddo is necessary.

Still working on it...

_My prediction of the result : CNN will focuse on the Magic Hat to recognite kiddo._
