# CNN

> A convolutional neural network is a DNN which can take 2D or hiegher dimension tensor as input.
> As it is strong at pattern detection, it is commonly used in the image processing, e.g., image classifier, image GAN...

Today CNN can be easily trained by personal computer thanks to high performance GPU and advanced semiconductor processing. 

## handwritten digits

> Multi class classification like handwritten digits recognition can be done if we have enougth data to train our CNN.

* __Traingin__

NN : 2 layers of CNN and one layer of FC network.

After training with 60000 data, Cross entropy is minimize to ~0.05 and the testing accuracy is up to ~98%

* __Prediction__

CNN make prediction after seeing these picture: 

![Prediction](/articles/20210603/p2.png "Prediction")

In these 25 pictures, it makes all the prediction right.

But there are still some mistakes:

## How about Kudō Shin-ichi and Kaitō Kiddo?

> For Mori Ran's happiness, a machine which can tell between Shin-ichi and Kiddo is necessary.

It's a simple CNN binary classification with 3 convolution layer and 2 fully connection layer.

My data set : 300 picture of each character.

* __Training Loss after 50 epoch__

* __Testing data__

The number above the picture is the output from machine.

As it close to 1, the posibility of the machine consider the input image to be kiddo is higher.

> Shin-ichi <- 0 ....... 1 -> kiddo

![Testing data](/articles/20210603/p5.png "Testing data")

I guess CNN focuse on the Magic Hat to recognite kiddo.

* __So I try these testing data:__

![Testing data](/articles/20210603/p6.png "Testing data")

Even the character is not Shin-ichi or Kiddo, but with a hat:

To visuallize what exactly does CNN see, we can use _Saliency map_.

I'll implement the Saliency map of this net work if I can spare more time...

> Who am I ? "PIKACHU !"

![next article](/articles/20210603/pnext.jpg "next article")

I'll try to use cGAN (conditional Generative Adversarial Network) to make every shadow into PIKACHU.
